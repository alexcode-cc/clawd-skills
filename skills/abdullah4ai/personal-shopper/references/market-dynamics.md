# Market Dynamics — Saudi Arabia (Riyadh Focus)

## Price Inversion

When a product costs more locally than international price + shipping + customs. Common in Saudi due to distribution layers.

**Threshold:** Gap must exceed 30% to flag. Below that, local advantages (warranty, returns, fast delivery) justify the premium.

## 4 Pricing Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Price Impact | Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Direct Distribution | Company sells via own store | Close to international | Apple Store SA, Samsung SA |
| Reseller/Importer | Third party imports, sells on Amazon/noon | 20-60% above international | Most small brands on Amazon.sa |
| Official Distributor | Authorized with contract | 10-25% above, local warranty | Jarir for many brands |
| Exclusive Product | Designed for local market | No international comparison | Some STC devices |
