# Workflow (bootstrap)

1. Capture service objective and strict non-goals.
2. Create context pack (`project-context`, `rules`, key specs, skill-graph entrypoint).
3. Define config-driven governance (`policy_checks`, `fact_resolution`, `routing`).
4. Create implementation plans with step-by-step verification matrix.
5. Add one-pass launch prompt with QA defect loop.
6. Produce readiness checklist with explicit YES/NO decision.

Keep coding blocked until step 6 passes.
