# Pricing Strategy

## Overview
Pricing is the fastest lever to pull on revenue — and the one solopreneurs get wrong most often, almost always by undercharging. This playbook walks you from first principles (what is the value actually worth?) through to a concrete pricing structure you can ship, test, and iterate on.

## Step 1: Anchor to Value, Not Cost

The most common solopreneur pricing mistake: calculating how long something takes to build, dividing by an hourly rate, and charging that. This is cost-plus pricing. It caps your income at your hours and ignores what the customer actually gains.

**Value-based pricing starts from the other direction:** What is the outcome worth to the customer?

**Value calculation framework:**
1. Identify the measurable outcome your product delivers (e.g., "saves 5 hours/week", "increases conversion by 15%", "reduces churn by 20%")
2. Quantify that outcome in dollars for your target customer (e.g., "5 hours/week × $75/hr billable rate × 50 weeks = $18,750/year saved")
3. Price as a fraction of that value. Industry norms: 10-30% of value delivered is a healthy range. Charging less than 10% signals low confidence. Charging more than 30% requires exceptional proof.

**Example:** If your tool saves a freelancer $18,750/year, pricing at $150/month ($1,800/year) = 9.6% of value. Reasonable. Pricing at $500/month ($6,000/year) = 32% of value. Aggressive but possible with strong proof.

## Step 2: Benchmark Against Competitors

Value-based pricing gives you a ceiling. Competitor pricing gives you market context.

- Collect pricing from your top 3-5 competitors (from your competitive analysis).
- Map their price points across tiers.
- Identify the price ranges: where does the market cluster? Where are the gaps?

**Positioning rules:**
- **Price ABOVE market average** if your product delivers more value, is easier to use, or has better support. Justify it clearly.
- **Price AT market average** if you're entering a mature market and need to earn trust first. Differentiate on value, not price.
- **Price BELOW market average** only if you have a structural cost advantage or are using a freemium model where the free tier is the acquisition channel. Do not race to the bottom out of insecurity.

## Step 3: Choose a Pricing Model

The model matters as much as the number. Pick the one that aligns with how your customers think about value.

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Flat-rate** | One price, everything included | Simple products. Customers hate surprises. Easy to budget. |
| **Per-user / Per-seat** | Price scales with team size | B2B tools where usage grows with team. Natural expansion revenue. |
| **Usage-based** | Price scales with consumption (API calls, storage, transactions) | Infrastructure, APIs, high-variance usage products. |
| **Tiered (good/better/best)** | 3 tiers with increasing features and price | Most SaaS products. Anchoring and upsell built in. |
| **Freemium** | Free tier + paid upgrades | Products where usage is the best marketing. Requires viral or sticky product. |
| **One-time purchase** | Pay once, own forever | Digital products, templates, tools with no ongoing hosting cost. |
| **Retainer / Monthly service** | Fixed monthly fee for ongoing work | Consulting, agency, managed services. Predictable revenue. |
| **Hybrid** | Combination (e.g., flat base + usage overage) | When base value is fixed but usage can spike. |

**Solopreneur recommendation:** Start with flat-rate or tiered. These are simplest to communicate, easiest to predict revenue from, and lowest friction at checkout.

## Step 4: Design Your Pricing Tiers (If Tiered)

Three tiers is the sweet spot. More than three confuses. Fewer than two leaves money on the table.

**Tier design principles:**

**Tier 1 (Entry):** The lowest price that's sustainable. Serves customers with the smallest need or budget. Should cover your marginal cost of serving them.

**Tier 2 (Core):** This is where you want most customers to land. Price it so the value jump from Tier 1 is obvious and worth it. This tier should cover the majority of your revenue.

**Tier 3 (Premium):** For customers with the biggest needs. Include features that only power users need. This tier also serves as a price anchor — it makes Tier 2 feel like a great deal by comparison.

**Anchoring rule:** Put Tier 3 first on your pricing page. Humans anchor to the first number they see. Seeing a high number first makes the middle tier feel reasonable.

**Feature distribution:**
- Tier 1: Core functionality only. Enough to deliver value, limited enough to create upgrade incentive.
- Tier 2: Core + the features that most customers actually want.
- Tier 3: Everything + power features, priority support, advanced analytics, or white-labeling.

## Step 5: Price Psychologically

Small pricing decisions compound. Apply these where appropriate:

- **End in 9:** $49 feels less than $50. $99 feels less than $100. This works.
- **Annual discount:** Offer 20-30% off for annual payment. This locks in revenue, improves cash flow, and reduces churn. Frame it as "Save $X/year" not "20% off."
- **Per-day framing:** "$0.99/day" sounds less than "$29/month" even though they're the same. Use this in marketing copy, not on the pricing page (that feels deceptive).
- **Free trial over freemium (for B2B):** A 14-day free trial of the full product often converts better than a limited free tier. The customer experiences the full value before deciding.
- **Social proof next to price:** A customer count, a rating, or a quote right beside the price reduces purchase anxiety.

## Step 6: Price Test and Iterate

Your first price is a hypothesis. Test it.

**Testing approach:**
1. Launch with your planned pricing.
2. Track two metrics for the first 30 days: conversion rate (visitors → paying customers) and churn rate (paying → cancelling).
3. Interpret:
   - Conversion too low (< 2% for SaaS) → Price may be too high, OR the value isn't communicated clearly enough. Test both.
   - Churn too high (> 5%/month) → Product isn't delivering on its price promise. Fix the product or lower the price.
   - Both conversion and retention are strong → You may be underpriced. Test a 20-30% increase on new customers.

**Price increase playbook (when ready to raise):**
- Never raise prices on existing customers without 30+ days notice.
- Grandfather existing customers at their current rate for 6-12 months.
- Frame increases as "we're adding more value" not "we're charging more."
- Raise prices on new customers first. See if conversion holds. If it does, the market supports the new price.

## Pricing Mistakes to Avoid
- Undercharging because you feel guilty or insecure. You are solving a real problem. Charge for it.
- Pricing based on what YOU would pay, not what your TARGET CUSTOMER would pay. Different people, different budgets.
- Never testing or changing prices. Pricing should be revisited quarterly minimum.
- Offering too many tiers or add-ons. Complexity kills conversion. Keep it simple.
- Discounting heavily at launch to get early customers. It trains customers to expect low prices and devalues your product. Offer a limited-time launch price instead, with a clear end date.
