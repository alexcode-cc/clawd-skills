# Where to Find User Context

Before recommending, search these sources in order:

## 1. Memory Files

Primary preference storage:
- `memory/*.md` — Category-specific files (movies.md, food.md, etc.)
- `MEMORY.md` — General preferences and patterns
- Decision history from `decide` skill if installed

**Search for:** Explicit likes/dislikes, past choices, stated values.

## 2. Conversation History

Recent and relevant discussions:
- Direct statements: "I love X", "I hate Y"
- Reactions to suggestions: accepted, modified, rejected
- Complaints and praise about past recommendations
- Context clues: time constraints, mood, occasion

**Search for:** Pattern of choices, implicit preferences, feedback on past recommendations.

## 3. Behavioral Signals

Actions speak louder than words:
- What they actually chose (not just said they'd choose)
- Frequency of certain choices
- Exceptions to stated preferences
- Abandoned or regretted decisions

**Search for:** Gaps between stated and revealed preferences.

## 4. Ask Directly

When data is insufficient:
- Closed questions: "Do you prefer A or B?"
- Constraint discovery: "What's your budget/time/limit?"
- Priority ranking: "Speed, quality, or price—pick two"

**Rule:** Targeted questions > open-ended. "What do you want?" yields less than "Sweet or savory?"
