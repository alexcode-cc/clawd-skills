## ☕ Coffee Culture

### The Flat White Origin Story
Sydney (along with Melbourne) claims to have invented the **flat white** in the 1980s. It's a double shot of espresso with steamed milk and microfoam—smaller and stronger than a latte, served in a ceramic cup.

**What to expect:**
- Average flat white: **$5–$6 AUD**
- Long black (Americano equivalent): **$4.50–$5.50 AUD**
- Filter/batch brew: **$5–$6 AUD**

### Third Wave Coffee Scene
Sydney's third-wave coffee movement emphasizes single-origin beans, lighter roasts, and precision brewing.

## 💰 Tipping

**The short version: Tipping is NOT expected in Australia.**

Australian hospitality workers earn a livable minimum wage (around $24+/hour for casual), unlike the US where tips subsidize low wages.

### When to Tip
- **Great service at fine dining:** 10% is generous
- **Exceptional experience:** Round up or add $10–$20
- **Counter service (cafes, casual):** Not expected at all
- **Food delivery:** Optional, $2–$5 for good service

### How It Works
- Most card machines offer tip options (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%)
- Choosing 0% is completely normal and not rude
- Cash tips go directly to staff
- Card tips may or may not reach servers (depends on venue)

**Bottom line:** Tip if you want to show appreciation for outstanding service, but there's zero social pressure. Locals tip rarely, tourists more often.
