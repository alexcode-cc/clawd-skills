Practical advice for getting the most out of Sydney, from a local's perspective.

## 🚇 Getting Around — Transport Essentials

### Opal Card
Sydney's public transport runs on the **Opal system** — a contactless smartcard or tap-and-go payment.

**How to get one:**
- **Free** from any newsagent, 7-Eleven, or convenience store (look for "Opal" sign)
- Just ask for an Adult Opal card — no registration needed
- You'll need to load credit before first use (minimum $10-20 recommended)
- **Alternative:** Use any contactless credit/debit card or Apple Pay/Google Pay directly on readers

**How to use:**
- **Tap on** at the start of your journey (at the reader/gate)
- **Tap off** when you arrive — this is critical! Forgetting costs you the maximum fare
- Works on trains, buses, ferries, and light rail

**Daily & Weekly Caps (Adult, 2026):**
| Day | Cap |
|-----|-----|
| Mon-Thu | $19.30/day |
| Fri-Sun + Public Holidays | $9.65/day |
| Weekly | $50/week |

**Pro tips:**
- The **Sunday cap is incredible** — travel all day for $9.65. Perfect for day trips!
- 30% discount for off-peak travel (after 9am weekdays, all day weekends)
- Free transfers within 60 minutes between modes
- The Opal network covers Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Hunter, and Illawarra

### Best Transport Apps
- **TripView** — The app locals use. Offline timetables, real-time updates, clean interface. Worth the $5
- **Opal Travel** (official) — Check balance, trip history, top up
- **Google Maps** — Good backup for route planning
- **Citymapper** — Excellent for tourists, shows multiple options

### Transport Tips
- Ferries are public transport (not tourist boats) — same Opal card, incredible views
- Circular Quay → Manly ferry is $7.79 but worth every cent
- Trains run frequently until midnight, less often after
- Night buses (Nxx) run when trains stop
- Uber/Didi work well, but traffic can make ferries/trains faster

## 💰 Money Tips

### Payments
- **Contactless is everywhere** — even market stalls and buskers take tap
- Cash is rarely needed; some places don't even accept it
- No need to carry much physical money

### ATMs
- Big bank ATMs (CommBank, Westpac, NAB, ANZ) are **fee-free** if you use any of their ATMs
- Avoid ATMs in convenience stores, clubs, or casinos — $2-3 fees
- Airport ATMs charge premium fees — withdraw in the city instead

### Currency Exchange
- **Avoid airport exchange** — worst rates
- Better options: Travel Money Oz, UAE Exchange in the CBD
- Best option: Just use your card everywhere (check your bank's forex fees beforehand)

### Tipping
**Tipping is NOT expected in Australia.**
- Service staff earn proper wages ($24-28+/hr minimum)
- Tipping is appreciated but never required
- If service was exceptional: 10% is generous, rounding up is common
- No one will chase you or judge you for not tipping
- Some restaurants add a 10-15% surcharge on public holidays — this is legal and displayed

---

## ☀️ Sun & Beach Safety

### UV Reality Check
**Australian UV is brutal. No exaggeration.**
- The ozone layer is thinner over Australia
- You can burn in 10-15 minutes on a summer day
- "But it's cloudy" — you'll still burn
- UV index regularly hits 11-14+ (extreme starts at 11)

**What to do:**
- SPF 50+ sunscreen, reapply every 2 hours (and after swimming)
- Wear a hat and sunglasses
- Seek shade 10am-4pm
- **Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek, Slide** — the Australian mantra

### Beach Safety — Rip Currents

**Rips are the #1 danger.** More dangerous than sharks, jellyfish, everything else combined.

**The flags system:**
- 🔴🟡 **Red and yellow flags** = Swim here. Patrolled area.
- 🔴 **Red flag only** = Beach closed. Dangerous. Don't swim.
- ⚫🟡 **Black and white quartered** = Surfcraft area (boards, kayaks). No swimming.
- 🟡 **Yellow flag** = Caution. Conditions may be rough.

**What are rips?**
- Strong currents that pull you out to sea
- Look like calm channels between breaking waves (deceptively inviting)
- Even strong swimmers can't fight them

**If caught in a rip:**
1. **Don't panic.** Don't fight it.
2. Swim **parallel** to the beach until out of the current
3. Then swim back to shore at an angle
4. If struggling, float and raise your arm — lifesavers will come
5. Or let it carry you out, then swim around it (rips don't pull you under)

**Surf Life Savers:**
- Volunteer heroes in red and yellow uniforms
- Patrol most popular beaches Sept-April, weekends and holidays
- Always ask them about conditions before swimming
- **App:** Beachsafe — shows patrol times and conditions

### Water Fountains (Bubblers)
Australians call drinking fountains "bubblers." You'll find them:
- In every park
- Along coastal walks
- At beaches near the facilities
- Train stations

Sydney tap water is excellent — bring a reusable bottle.

## 🦘 Safety & Wildlife

### General Safety
**Sydney is very safe.** Genuinely one of the world's safest major cities.
- Violent crime is rare
- Walking alone at night is generally fine in most areas
- Standard precautions apply (watch belongings at beaches, don't leave bags in cars)
- Biggest danger is honestly the sun and rips

### Wildlife
**In the city, wildlife is minimal:**
- **Ibis** ("bin chickens") — will steal your food. Harmless but annoying
- **Possums** — nocturnal, cute, won't bother you
- **Cockatoos, lorikeets** — beautiful but loud

**Things that exist but you likely won't encounter:**
- **Funnel-web spiders** — Extremely dangerous but rarely seen. Don't stick hands in dark garden crevices
- **Redback spiders** — Check under outdoor toilet seats and in sheds. Painful bite, treatable
- **Snakes** — In bushland, not city streets. Make noise when walking, they'll avoid you
- **Sharks** — Statistical non-issue. Nets and drone patrols protect beaches. More people die from horses

**If bitten by a snake or spider:**
- Stay calm, immobilize the limb
- Call 000 (emergency) immediately
- Don't try to catch or identify it (but a photo helps)
- Antivenom is effective and available

### Bushfire Season
**October to March** is bushfire season.
- Check conditions if heading to Blue Mountains or national parks
- Follow the **Fires Near Me NSW** app for alerts
- On **Total Fire Ban** days, some tracks may close
- December-February highest risk

---

## 📅 Public Holiday Quirks

**Expect closures and reduced services:**
- **Christmas Day** — Almost nothing open. Seriously.
- **Boxing Day (26 Dec)** — Sales frenzy. Shops packed.
- **Good Friday** — Many things closed
- **ANZAC Day (25 Apr, before noon)** — Limited trading

**Benefits:**
- Public transport uses Sunday/public holiday caps
- Some attractions offer special hours or events
- Beaches are patrolled

**Quirk:** NSW has "local" public holidays — Bank Holiday (first Monday in August) only applies to banks, for example.
