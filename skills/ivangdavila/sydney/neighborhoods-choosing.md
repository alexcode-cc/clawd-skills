## 🎯 Final Decision Flowchart

```
Do you need a car?
├── YES → Hills District, Shire, Northern Beaches okay
└── NO → Stick to train/metro suburbs

What's your budget (2BR)?
├── <$600 → Western Sydney (Parramatta, Bankstown, Auburn)
├── $600-$800 → Middle suburbs (Strathfield, Burwood, St Leonards)
└── $800+ → Inner city or premium (Surry Hills, Bondi, Lower North Shore)

What matters most?
├── Beach → Bondi, Manly, Cronulla
├── Nightlife → Surry Hills, Newtown, Darlinghurst
├── Family → Hills District, Chatswood
├── Food → Bankstown, Hurstville, Strathfield
└── Commute → Near your office, always
```

**The golden rule:** Visit the suburb at night and on weekends before signing. Photos lie. Vibes don't.
