# Sydney Tech Industry Guide (Feb 2026)

## 1. Tech Scene Overview

Sydney is Australia's largest tech hub, though significantly smaller than Silicon Valley or major US tech cities. The ecosystem has matured considerably since 2020, with multiple unicorn success stories proving the market's viability.

### Scale & Growth
- **Market size**: ~$167B Australian tech sector (2025), Sydney accounts for ~40%
- **Startup ecosystem**: 2,500+ active startups, though most are seed/Series A
- **Unicorns born here**: Atlassian ($50B+), Canva ($26B), Afterpay (acquired by Block for $39B)
- **Reality check**: Most companies are small-medium; true large-scale engineering teams are limited to big tech offices and a handful of locals

### Tech Hubs & Precincts
| Area | Character | Notable Companies |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Sydney CBD** | Corporate, big tech, finance | Google, Salesforce, banks |
| **Pyrmont** | Media/tech convergence | Atlassian HQ (new tower), various studios |
| **Surry Hills** | Startup scene, creative | Canva, scale-ups, agencies |
| **North Sydney** | Corporate tech, consulting | Microsoft, various consultancies |

| **NAB** | NAB Labs | 3,000+ tech staff | Heavy cloud transformation |
