# Australian & Local Specialties in Sydney

## 🍴 Modern Australian Cuisine

### What It Means
"Modern Australian" (or "Mod Oz") is a culinary style unique to Australia that emerged in the 1990s. It combines:
- European techniques (especially French and Italian)
- Asian influences (Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese)
- Native Australian ingredients (bush tucker)
- Fresh, seasonal, local produce
- Emphasis on seafood and quality meats

It's characterized by bold flavour combinations, lighter preparations than traditional European cooking, and creative fusion without strict rules.
