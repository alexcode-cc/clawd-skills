## Practical Tips

1. **Inspect at night and weekends** — see the real noise levels.
2. **Check which way unit faces** — west-facing = hot summers.
3. **Ask about building works** — constant construction in CBD.
4. **Try before you commit** — Airbnb a week in your target area.
5. **Factor in aircon costs** — old buildings without it are miserable.
6. **Light rail noise** — units on George Street can be loud.
