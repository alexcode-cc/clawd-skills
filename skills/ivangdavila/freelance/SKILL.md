## Platform Selection

| Goal | Best Platform | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Long-term contracts | Upwork | Escrow, hourly tracking |
| Quick productized gigs | Fiverr | SEO-driven discovery |
| Budget projects | Freelancer.com | Lower fees, contests |
| Premium talent | Toptal | Vetted top 3% |

## Winning Proposals (Upwork/Freelancer)

Structure: Hook → Plan → Proof → CTA (150-250 words)

```
Two things stood out: [specific_1] and [specific_2].

My approach:
• [Step 1 with acceptance criteria]
• [Step 2 with deliverable]  
• [Step 3 with timeline]

Recently, I [achievement] for [client type], resulting in [metric]. Sample: [link]

Phase 1: [deliverables] by [date] — [price]. Quick call to align?
```

Never: generic intros, vague timelines, no samples, underbidding drastically.

## Client Red Flags

Reject immediately:
- Unverified payment + no hire history
- "Work for exposure/equity only"
- Requests to move off-platform before contract
- Asks for free test work upfront
- Unrealistic pay claims

## Pricing Strategy

- New (0-3 months): 15-20% below market, focus on reviews
- Established (3-12 months): Market rate, raise 10% every 3-5 projects
- Expert (12+ months): Premium pricing, selective projects

Formula: `(Target Annual ÷ 1500 billable hours) × 1.25 = minimum hourly`

## AI Disclosure Requirements

**EU (AI Act):** Mandatory disclosure of AI-generated content to clients.
**US:** No federal mandate, but FTC prohibits deceptive AI claims.
**All platforms:** ToS prohibit full automation — human must review/approve all proposals and deliverables.

For legal deep-dive, see `legal.md`.
