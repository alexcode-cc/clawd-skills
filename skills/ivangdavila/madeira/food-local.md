**Vegetarian version**: Some places offer vegetable espetada (mushrooms, peppers) on request.

## What to Avoid

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Tourist-menu "traditional" | Often frozen, microwaved, overpriced |
| Expensive restaurants on Zona Velha main drag | Pay for location, not quality |
| Seafood platters at tourist spots | Often frozen imports; ask origin |
| "International" dishes at local restaurants | Not their strength |

## How to Order Like a Local

1. **Ask what's fresh**: "O que é que tem de fresco hoje?"
2. **Consider prato do dia**: Daily special, usually excellent value
3. **Half portions**: "Meia dose" if eating solo
4. **Don't fear fish by weight**: It's normal; just ask price first
5. **End with fruit**: Order from dessert menu; often comes with honey

## Dietary Notes

### Vegetarians
Limited traditional options. Look for:
- Vegetable soup (ask if stock is meat-free)
- Tomada (cheese bread)
- Salads (may be basic)
- Egg dishes

### Gluten-Free
Tricky. Bolo do caco has wheat. Most breaded fish has gluten. Grilled meats/fish usually safe.

### Pork Products
In almost everything. If avoiding pork, ask carefully—even vegetable dishes may use chouriço for flavoring.
