# Moving to Madeira — Resident Guide

## Before You Move

### Key Questions to Answer

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| EU citizen? | Determines visa requirements |
| Income source? | Affects visa type and tax situation |
| Family? | Schools, healthcare, housing size |
| Budget? | €1,000/month vs €3,000/month are different lifestyles |
| Work situation? | Remote, local job, starting business? |
| Timeline? | Tourist trial vs. immediate relocation |

### Recommended Process

1. **Visit first** (1-2 weeks minimum, ideally 1 month)
2. **Test different areas** — Funchal, villages, different coasts
3. **Connect with expats** — Facebook groups, nomad community
4. **Understand costs** — real numbers, not estimates
5. **Sort visa/legal** — before committing to property
6. **Find accommodation** — furnished first, unfurnished later

## Finding Accommodation

### Short-Term First

### Long-Term Rental

**Where to look:**

**Typical costs (2024-2025):**

| Area | 1BR | 2BR | 3BR |
|------|-----|-----|-----|

3. **Underestimating car needs** — Outside Funchal, car is essential
4. **Not getting NIF early** — Blocks everything else
5. **Ignoring tax implications** — Get professional advice
6. **Expecting mainland pace** — Madeira is slower, embrace it
