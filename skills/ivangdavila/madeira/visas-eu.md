### What You Need
- Valid passport or national ID card
- That's it

### What You Can Do

## Staying Longer (3+ Months)

### Registration Requirement

After 3 months, EU citizens must register with local authorities:

**Document**: Certificado de Registo de Cidadão da União Europeia

**Where**: Câmara Municipal (Town Hall) in your area of residence

**What you need**:
- Passport or national ID
- Proof of address (rental contract, utility bill)
- Proof of resources OR employment OR enrollment in studies
- Health insurance or EHIC

### "Proof of Resources"

This is flexible. Options include:

**Reality**: Portugal doesn't aggressively enforce this. If you can show you won't be a burden on social services, you're generally fine.
