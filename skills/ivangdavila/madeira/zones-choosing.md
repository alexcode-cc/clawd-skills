## Profiles & Recommendations

### The First-Timer
**3-7 days, wants to see highlights**

**Stay**: Funchal old town or center
**Why**: Walking distance to everything, best restaurants, easy transport hub
**Avoid**: North coast (too far for short trip)

### The Digital Nomad (Social)
**1-3 months, wants community**

**Stay**: Ponta do Sol (Digital Nomad Village)
**Why**: Built-in community, coworking, events, like-minded people
**Alternative**: Funchal center if you prefer city life + making own connections

### The Digital Nomad (Independent)
**1-6 months, self-sufficient**

**Stay**: Funchal center (coworking access) or Caniço (quieter, cheaper)
**Why**: Infrastructure without the nomad bubble
**Avoid**: Ponta do Sol if you dislike organized community vibe

### The Budget Seeker
**Long-term, cost matters most**

**Stay**: North coast (Porto Moniz, São Vicente) or Santa Cruz/Machico
**Why**: Lowest rents, still livable
**Trade-off**: Limited services, need car, less social

### The Beach Lover
**Wants swimming in daily life**

**Stay**: Caniço (lidos + pebble beach) or Machico (sand beach)
**Why**: Best consistent beach access
**Note**: Madeira is not a beach destination overall

### The Hiker
**Levadas are the main reason for coming**

**Stay**: Funchal (central base) or Santana (north-side immersion)
**Why**: Funchal = access all levadas by car; Santana = immediate access to best ones
**Avoid**: North coast (too far for variety)

### The Family
**Kids, stability, schools**

**Stay**: Caniço, Santa Cruz, or Funchal suburbs
**Why**: Space, schools, pools, safety
**Consider**: Near international school if relevant

### The Retiree
**Peaceful, affordable, quality of life**

**Stay**: Câmara de Lobos (authentic + cheap) or Caniço (beach + expats)
**Why**: Value, community, climate
**Avoid**: North coast unless very independent

## The Test Run Strategy

If unsure where to base:

1. **Week 1**: Stay in Funchal (central, explore all areas)
2. **Week 2**: Stay in top 2 candidate areas (2-3 nights each)
3. **Decision**: You'll feel which one fits

**Don't lock into 6-month lease until you've tested.**

Most people who plan to live outside Funchal end up in Funchal for practical reasons. Those who specifically seek quiet/nature are happier outside.
