### Safe at Night

## Natural Hazards

### Hiking Risks

| Risk | Seriousness | Prevention |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Falls | Moderate | Stay on path, proper footwear |
| Vertigo issues | Moderate | Know your limits, skip exposed routes |
| Weather changes | Moderate | Check forecast, bring layers |
| Getting lost | Low | GPS, stick to marked routes |
| Dehydration | Low | Carry water |

**Reality**: Most levadas are safe with basic precautions. But "easy" still means uneven terrain, some exposure.

### Ocean Risks

| Risk | Where | Prevention |
|------|-------|------------|
| Strong currents | Open coast, north | Swim in protected areas/lidos |
| Rough seas | North coast especially | Respect closures |
| Slippery rocks | Everywhere | Water shoes, careful movement |
| Cold water | Year-round | Know your limits |

**Key**: Swim in designated areas. Porto Moniz pools and lidos exist because open ocean swimming is often unsafe.

### Weather Hazards

| Hazard | When | What to Do |
|--------|------|------------|
| Flash floods | Winter storms | Avoid low areas during heavy rain |
| Mountain fog | Any time | Turn back if visibility drops |
| Strong winds | Winter | Check forecasts, avoid exposed areas |
| Landslides | After heavy rain | Stay on main roads |
