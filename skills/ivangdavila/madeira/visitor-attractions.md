# Madeira Attractions — Must-See vs Skip

## Absolute Must-See

### Pico do Areeiro & Pico Ruivo
**Madeira's highest peaks with otherworldly volcanic landscape.**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Pico do Areeiro | 1,818m — drive up, parking at top |
| Pico Ruivo | 1,862m — hike only (from Areeiro or Achada do Teixeira) |
| Best time | Early morning before clouds roll in |
| Difficulty | Areeiro = easy (drive up), Ruivo hike = moderate/hard (3h one way) |

**Why go**: Lunar landscape above the clouds. On clear days, see entire island.
**Skip if**: Vertigo issues (exposed sections on hike), mobility limitations.

### Levada Walks (Top 3)
**Madeira's iconic irrigation channel walks through laurel forests.**

| Levada | Difficulty | Distance | Highlights |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Levada das 25 Fontes** | Moderate | 11km round trip | 25 waterfalls at end, UNESCO forest |
| **Levada do Caldeirão Verde** | Moderate | 13km round trip | Green caldron waterfall, tunnels |
| **Levada do Rei** | Easy | 10km round trip | Accessible, lush forest, minimal exposure |

**Why go**: Nothing else like it in Europe — walking through ancient laurisilva forest.
**Warning**: "Easy" doesn't mean safe for everyone; many have drops on one side.

### Funchal Old Town (Zona Velha)
**Historic center with painted doors, restaurants, and cable car.**

| Spot | What |
|------|------|
| Rua Santa Maria | Famous painted doors art project |
| Mercado dos Lavradores | Farmers market (fruit, flowers, fish) |
| Sé (Cathedral) | 15th century, Manueline architecture |
| Cable car to Monte | 15-min ride with panoramic views |

**Why go**: Best dining, nightlife, and atmosphere on the island.
**Tip**: Market best in morning; painted doors throughout the day.

### Monte Palace Gardens & Toboggan
**Historic gardens above Funchal with famous wicker toboggan ride down.**

| Part | Details |
|------|---------|
| Gardens | Tropical plants, azulejos, oriental collection |
| Toboggan | Wicker sled guided by 2 men, 2km downhill, ~10 min |
| Getting there | Cable car from Funchal or car/taxi |
| Toboggan cost | ~€30 per person |

**Why go**: Unique experience — traditional transport from 19th century.
**Skip if**: Mobility issues (gardens are steep), budget-conscious (toboggan expensive for 10 min).

### Porto Moniz Natural Pools
**Volcanic rock pools on the wild north coast.**

| Pool | Details |
|------|---------|
| Main complex | Larger pools, €3 entry, facilities, lifeguards |
| Natural pools | Free, rougher access, more authentic |
| Best time | Summer months; winter seas too rough |

**Why go**: Swim in crystal clear Atlantic water protected from waves.
**Warning**: Can be closed in bad weather; check before driving 1.5h.

### Câmara de Lobos
**Picturesque fishing village painted by Churchill.**

| Highlight | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Harbor | Colorful boats, sea wall viewpoint |
| Churchill's spot | Plaque where he painted in 1950 |
| Poncha | Birthplace of the drink, try at local bars |
| Cape Girão | Nearby: Europe's highest sea cliff (580m) with glass skywalk |

**Why go**: Authentic Madeira fishing culture, excellent poncha, dramatic cliffs.
**Tip**: Combine with Cape Girão for half-day trip.

## Worth Your Time

### Santana Traditional Houses
Traditional A-frame thatched houses (palheiros), tourist site but charming.
**Visit**: 30 minutes to walk around; combine with north coast drive.

### Blandy's Wine Lodge
Learn about Madeira wine in historic lodge, tasting included.
**Best for**: Wine enthusiasts, rainy day activity.

### Botanical Garden (Jardim Botânico)
Formal gardens with island views and exotic plants.
**Best for**: Plant lovers, alternative to Monte Gardens.

### Machico
Second largest town, good beach (sand imported from Morocco), local feel.
**Best for**: Beach day away from crowds, authentic restaurants.

### Ribeira Brava
West coast town with good beach, market, and mountain access.
**Best for**: Base for west side exploration.

## Skip or Lower Priority

### "Skywalk" at Cabo Girão
Glass platform over cliff — crowded, small, 5-minute experience. **The regular viewing platform is free and almost as good.**

### Mini-golf / Kart tracks
Generic tourist activities that exist everywhere. **Not why you came to Madeira.**

### Madeira Story Centre
Interactive museum about island history. **Over-priced for what it is; skip unless with kids and raining.**

### Whale/dolphin watching (low season)
Winter sightings hit-or-miss. **Better odds May-October.**

### Hotel zone beaches
Lido and Praia Formosa are fine but nothing special. **Spend time in nature instead.**

## Day Trip Decision Guide

| Time Available | Do This |
|---------------|---------|
| Half day | Funchal Old Town + Market + Cable Car to Monte |
| Full day (easy) | Câmara de Lobos + Cape Girão + lunch in Ribeira Brava |

## Weather Backup Plans

When mountains are cloudy or it's raining:
- Blandy's Wine Lodge (Funchal)
- Mercado dos Lavradores (morning)
- CR7 Museum (if you care about football)
- Cozy restaurant day in Funchal old town
- Indoor pools at hotels

**Key insight**: Madeira's weather changes fast. Cloudy morning often becomes sunny afternoon. Check webcams before abandoning plans.
