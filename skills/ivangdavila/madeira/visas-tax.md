# Madeira Taxes: NHR & Tax Residency

## Tax Residency Basics

### When Are You Tax Resident?

You become Portuguese tax resident if:

| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| 183+ days | Spend 183 or more days in Portugal in a tax year |
| Habitual abode | Have a home in Portugal suggesting intention to stay |

**Important**: Tax residency is separate from visa/immigration status. You can be tax resident without permanent residency, and vice versa.

## NHR (Non-Habitual Resident) Regime

### What Is It?

A special tax regime that offered favorable rates for new residents. **Being phased out for new applicants in 2024.**

### Who Qualified (Before Phase-Out)

- Not tax resident in Portugal for previous 5 years
- Become tax resident in Portugal
- Apply within deadline after becoming resident

### Benefits (For Those Already In)

| Income Type | NHR Treatment |
|-------------|---------------|
| Portuguese employment (high-value activities) | 20% flat rate |
| Foreign employment income | Exempt (if taxed abroad) |
| Foreign pension | 10% flat rate |
| Foreign dividends/interest | Exempt (if taxable abroad) |
| Foreign rental income | Exempt (if taxable abroad) |
| Portuguese self-employment (high-value) | 20% flat rate |

### "High-Value Activities"

The 20% flat rate applied to specific professions:
- Engineers
- IT professionals
- Doctors
- University professors
- Architects
- Auditors
- Some others (specific list exists)

### Status for New Applicants (2024)

- **Original NHR**: Largely closed to new applicants
- **NHR 2.0 / IFICI**: New, more limited regime
- **Check current rules**: They're actively changing

---

## Current Options (2024+)

### If NHR Is Closed

Standard tax rates apply. Portugal has high marginal rates, especially for higher incomes.

### IFICI Regime

Portugal introduced a new incentive for research and innovation workers:
- Aimed at scientific research, tech
- More limited scope than NHR
- Professional advice needed

### Madeira Free Trade Zone (MIBC)

For businesses (not individuals directly):
- Reduced corporate tax rate (5%)
- Must operate within zone rules
- Complex setup, professional guidance essential

## For Digital Nomads

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Tax Situation |
|----------|---------------|
| <183 days, no habitual abode | Not Portuguese tax resident |
| 183+ days | Portuguese tax resident, world income taxed |
| Working for foreign employer, 183+ days | Complex—depends on many factors |
| Self-employed, 183+ days | Portuguese tax resident, register as self-employed |

### Double Taxation

Portugal has double tax treaties with many countries. These can:
- Prevent being taxed twice on same income
- Allocate taxing rights between countries
- Provide relief mechanisms

**Critical**: Get professional advice. Getting this wrong is expensive.

---

## Self-Employment Taxes

### If Working as Freelancer in Portugal

1. **Register** as self-employed (trabalhador independente)
2. **NIF** required
3. **Social security**: ~21.4% of income (exemptions first 12 months)
4. **Income tax**: Standard rates or NHR if eligible
5. **IVA (VAT)**: Register if turnover exceeds €14,500/year (or €13,500 for 2025+)
6. **Quarterly payments**: Estimated tax prepayments

### Simplified vs. Organized Regime

| Regime | For | How Income Calculated |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Simplified | <€200,000 turnover | 75% of income taxed (25% automatic deduction) |
| Organized | Higher turnover or choice | Actual expenses deducted |

## Property Tax

### IMI (Annual Property Tax)

## Getting Help

### What You Need

For anything beyond simple situations:
- **Tax accountant** (contabilista certificado)
- **Tax lawyer** (for complex structuring)
- **Immigration + tax coordination** (they interact)

### Costs

| Service | Typical Cost |
|---------|--------------|
| Annual tax filing (simple) | €50-150 |
| Tax residency planning | €200-500 |
| Complex structuring | €500-2,000+ |
| Ongoing accounting (self-employed) | €100-300/month |

### Finding Professionals

- Expat communities (recommendations)
- English-speaking firms in Lisbon/Porto
- Online services (some handle Portugal specifically)
- Local Funchal accountants (some speak English)

## Key Deadlines

| Task | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| Tax year | Calendar year (Jan 1 - Dec 31) |
| IRS filing (employed) | April 1 - June 30 |
| IRS filing (self-employed) | April 1 - June 30 |
| NHR application | By March 31 of year following tax residency |
| Social security registration | Before starting activity |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming short stay = no tax issues** — Even under 183 days can create obligations
2. **Not understanding habitual abode** — Renting long-term can establish residency
3. **Missing NHR deadline** — If eligible, must apply in time
4. **Ignoring home country obligations** — May still owe taxes there
5. **Not registering as self-employed** — Working without registration is illegal
6. **DIY complex situations** — Get professional help
