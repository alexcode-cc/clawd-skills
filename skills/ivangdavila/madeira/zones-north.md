# North Coast — Porto Moniz, São Vicente, Santana

## Overview

Madeira's north coast is wild, dramatic, and wet. Vertical cliffs plunge into the Atlantic, waterfalls cascade from mountains, and clouds roll through ancient forests. It's also significantly less developed—fewer tourists, fewer services, more nature. Perfect for those seeking immersion over convenience.

## North Coast Weather Reality

The north coast gets significantly more rain and cloud than the south:

| Factor | South Coast | North Coast |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Annual rainfall | ~600mm | ~1500mm |
| Cloudy days | 60/year | 120+/year |
| Temperature | Warmer | Cooler (especially mountains) |
| Wind | Moderate | Often strong |

**Why it matters**: Don't move to the north coast expecting sunny days. The trade-off is dramatic scenery, waterfalls, lush vegetation—all fed by that rain.

## Practical Considerations

### Getting There
- **By car**: Expressway to Ribeira Brava, then ER101/ER104 north
- **By bus**: Possible but infrequent (1-2 per day to some areas)
- **Drive time**: Add 50% for scenic coastal roads vs. tunnel routes

### Living There
- **Internet**: Fiber available in villages; rural areas may be slower
- **Shopping**: Small supermarkets only; big shops require Funchal trip
- **Healthcare**: Basic clinics; hospital is in Funchal (1h+)
- **Restaurants**: Limited options; learn to cook or accept repetition

### Reality Check
**North coast living is not for everyone.** It requires:
- Comfort with isolation
- Acceptance of rainy weather
- A car (non-negotiable)
- Self-sufficiency
- Appreciation for nature over nightlife

**For whom it's perfect:** Writers, artists, nature lovers, remote workers who want zero distractions, retirees seeking peace, serious hikers making it a base.
