## Practical Tips for All Itineraries

**Car rental**: Essential for Days 2-4. Funchal walkable.

**Start early**: Mountain clouds typically roll in by 11am.

**Pack layers**: 20°C difference between coast and peaks common.

**Book ahead**: Restaurants on weekends, levada transfers in peak season.

**Check webcams**:
- spotazores.com/madeira (multiple cameras)
- netmadeira.com/tempo (weather + cams)

**Motion sickness**: North coast drive is rough. Bring medication if sensitive.
