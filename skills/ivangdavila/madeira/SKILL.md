## Core Rules

### 1. Identify User Context First
- **Role**: Tourist, digital nomad, retiree, EU citizen, long-term resident
- **Timeline**: Short visit, winter escape, permanent move
- **Interests**: Hiking, beaches, remote work, retirement
- Load relevant auxiliary file for details

### 2. Island Geography
Madeira is a small volcanic island (~740 km²) with dramatic terrain:
- **South coast**: Sunnier, warmer, where most people live (Funchal, Caniço)
- **North coast**: Wilder, wetter, more dramatic scenery (São Vicente, Porto Moniz)
- **Mountains**: Central spine reaching 1,862m (Pico Ruivo) — often cloudy
- **Driving times**: Funchal to Porto Moniz ~1.5h, Funchal to Santana ~1h

### 3. Climate Reality (Eternal Spring)
- **Year-round mild**: 17-25°C most of the year
- **No extreme seasons**: Never too hot, rarely cold (sea level)
- **Microclimates**: North vs south, coast vs mountains dramatically different
- **Rain patterns**: More rain Nov-Feb, but brief showers common year-round
- **Mountain weather**: Can be 15°C colder than coast, often foggy
See `climate.md` for monthly breakdown.

### 4. Current Data (Feb 2026)

| Item | Range |
|------|-------|
| 1BR rent (Funchal center) | €700-1,000/month |
| 1BR rent (outside Funchal) | €500-750/month |
| Remote worker salary (typical) | €2,500-5,000/month |
| Bus monthly pass | €35 (Funchal), €45 (regional) |
| Restaurant meal | €8-15 (local), €20-40 (upscale) |
| Coffee + pastry | €2-3 |
| Supermarket (monthly, single) | €200-300 |

### 5. Cost Reality
Madeira is affordable by Western European standards:
- **Housing**: Biggest expense, prices rose 2020-2024 but stabilizing
- **Food**: Very affordable eating local; imported goods pricier
- **Healthcare**: Portuguese public system available to residents
- **Car**: Useful but not essential in Funchal (good bus network)
- **Flights**: Budget airlines connect to Lisbon, Porto, UK, Germany

### 6. Transport Options
Unlike mainland cities, Madeira has specific transport patterns:
- **Buses (Horários do Funchal)**: Good coverage, €1.95 per ride
- **Car rental**: Essential for exploring; €20-40/day
- **Taxis**: Fixed rates to popular destinations
- **No trains, no metro**: Island is small enough not to need them
- **Airport**: 20min from Funchal; famous challenging approach
See `transport.md` for detailed guidance.

### 7. Digital Nomad Hub
Madeira actively courts remote workers:
- **Digital Nomad Village** (Ponta do Sol): Purpose-built community with fast wifi
- **Coworking**: Multiple spaces in Funchal with good internet
- **Community**: Active nomad meetups, especially winter months
- **Connectivity**: Fiber widely available, 4G/5G coverage good
- **D7 Visa**: Portugal's passive income/remote work visa
See `nomad.md` for comprehensive guide.

### 8. Zone Matching

| Profile | Best Areas |
|---------|------------|
| Digital nomads | Ponta do Sol, Funchal center, Caniço |
| Beach lovers | Caniço, Machico, Porto Moniz (pools) |
| Hikers | Santana, Ribeira Brava, anywhere with levada access |
| Nightlife/urban | Funchal old town, hotel zone |
| Quiet/nature | North coast (São Vicente, Porto Moniz) |
| Budget-conscious | Machico, Santa Cruz, Câmara de Lobos |
| Families | Funchal suburbs, Caniço |

## EU vs Non-EU Context

Critical distinction for anyone considering Madeira:
- **EU citizens**: Can live and work freely, just need to register after 3 months
- **Non-EU citizens**: Need visa (D7 for passive income, Digital Nomad Visa, work visa)
- **NHR tax regime**: 10-year special tax status for new residents (being phased out for new applicants)
- **Golden Visa**: Investment-based residency (real estate route ended 2023)

See `visas-eu.md` and `visas-non-eu.md` for detailed requirements.

## Madeira-Specific Traps

- **Mountain weather** — Clear in Funchal doesn't mean clear at Pico Areeiro. Always check webcams.
- **Levada difficulty** — "Easy" levadas can still have exposed sections. Vertigo = problem.
- **Sunday closures** — Many restaurants and all supermarkets closed Sunday afternoon.
- **Rental car insurance** — Get full coverage; narrow mountain roads cause scrapes.
- **Flight delays** — Airport closes in high winds. Keep flexible travel dates.
- **Summer crowds** — August is peak; book levada shuttles and restaurants.
- **North coast swimming** — Ocean can be rough. Use natural pools, not open water.
- **Cruise ship days** — Funchal gets crowded when ships dock (check schedule).
- **Hairpin roads** — Driving to north coast involves hundreds of curves. Motion sickness is real.
- **Cash still matters** — Small restaurants and rural areas often cash-only.

## Cultural Context

Portuguese Atlantic culture with distinct identity:
- **Language**: Portuguese (English widely spoken in tourist areas)
- **Pace**: Slower than mainland, Mediterranean-influenced schedule
- **Hospitality**: Warm but reserved; not as effusive as mainland
- **Religion**: Catholic traditions, festivals important (especially Festa da Flor)
- **Alcohol**: Poncha (local spirit drink) and Madeira wine are traditions
- **Tipping**: 5-10% appreciated but not mandatory

See `food-local.md` and `food-drinks.md` for culinary culture.

## Best Times to Visit

| Season | Weather | Crowds | Best For |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Dec-Feb** | Mild (17-20°C), some rain | Low (except holidays) | Nomads, budget travelers |
| **Mar-May** | Warm (18-22°C), flowers | Medium | Hiking, Flower Festival |
| **Jun-Aug** | Hot (22-26°C), dry | High | Beaches, festivals |
| **Sep-Nov** | Warm (20-24°C), harvest | Medium | Wine harvest, mild crowds |

Year-round destination, but each season has different character.
