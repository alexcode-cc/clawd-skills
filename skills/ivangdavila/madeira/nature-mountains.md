# Madeira Mountains — Peaks & High Ground

## The Main Peaks

### Pico Ruivo (1,862m)
**Madeira's highest point — above the clouds**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Height | 1,862m (6,109 ft) |
| Access | Hike only (from Areeiro or Achada do Teixeira) |
| Difficulty | Moderate-Hard |
| Time | 3h from Areeiro, 1.5h from Achada do Teixeira |

**The experience**: Standing on Madeira's roof with clouds below you, potentially seeing the entire island. On clear days, Porto Santo island visible.

**Best approach**:
- From Pico do Areeiro (7km, more dramatic, harder)
- From Achada do Teixeira (2.5km, easier, less scenic approach)

### Pico do Areeiro (1,818m)
**The accessible peak — drive to the top**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Height | 1,818m (5,965 ft) |
| Access | Paved road to summit |
| Difficulty | Easy (driving) |
| Time | 1h from Funchal |
| Facilities | Café, parking, viewpoint |

**Why go**: This is where you can drive up and experience high altitude without hiking. Sunrise here is legendary — above the clouds, watching the sun rise.

**Tips**:
- Arrive before dawn for sunrise
- Check webcam first (netmadeira.com/tempo)
- Bring warm clothes — 15°C+ colder than coast
- Can be foggy when clear below (and vice versa)

### Pico das Torres (1,851m)
**The middle peak between Areeiro and Ruivo**

Part of the classic hike, not a destination itself. Dramatic rock formations, tunnels, exposed sections.

## The Areeiro-Ruivo Hike

**The most spectacular hike on the island.**

### Route Options

| Route | Distance | Time | Difficulty |
|-------|----------|------|------------|
| Areeiro → Ruivo → return | 14km | 6-7h | Hard |
| Areeiro → Ruivo → Achada | 10km | 4-5h | Hard (need transport) |
| Achada → Ruivo → return | 5km | 3h | Moderate |

### What to Expect

1. **From Areeiro**: Stairs, tunnels, exposed sections with cables
2. **Pico das Torres area**: Most dramatic terrain, vertiginous
3. **Approaching Ruivo**: Final ascent, shelter at top
4. **Summit**: 360° views (if clear), basic café

### Conditions

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Weather | Changes rapidly; can go from clear to fog in minutes |
| Temperature | 10-15°C colder than coast |
| Wind | Can be extreme; exposed ridge |
| Crowds | Popular; start early |
| Difficulty | Real mountain hike, not a stroll |

### Safety

- **Not for vertigo sufferers**: Serious exposure
- **Proper boots**: Essential
- **Layers**: Temperature drops fast
- **Water + food**: Nothing between Areeiro café and Ruivo
- **Headlamp**: Tunnels are dark
- **Bail-out option**: Turn around at any point

## Paul da Serra

**Madeira's high plateau — a different landscape**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Height | ~1,400m average |
| Size | 24 km² |
| Character | Flat moorland, wind farms, fog |
| Access | Drive (ER110 road) |

**What it's like**: Unlike anywhere else on Madeira — flat, almost Scottish highland feel. Fog common. Wind turbines. Starting point for several levadas.

**Why visit**:
- Different landscape
- Access to western levadas (25 Fontes starts nearby)
- Vereda do Fanal (ancient forest walk)
- Weird, atmospheric when foggy

## Other Notable High Points

### Bica da Cana (1,620m)
Viewpoint on Paul da Serra with views toward Curral das Freiras. Easy access, parking.

### Encumeada Pass (1,007m)
Mountain pass between north and south. Good starting point for walks. Restaurant. Dramatic views both directions.

### Curral das Freiras
**The "Valley of the Nuns" — not a peak but essential**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| What | Deep volcanic valley surrounded by peaks |
| Access | Winding road from Funchal (30min) |
| Viewpoints | Eira do Serrado (best), various along road |
| Village | Small settlement in valley floor |

**Why go**: The most dramatic viewpoint on the island. Looking down into this collapsed volcanic crater is vertiginous and spectacular.

**Tips**:
- View from Eira do Serrado viewpoint above
- Can drive down to village for lunch (chestnuts specialty)
- Fog can ruin views; check weather

## Practical Information

### Getting There

| Peak | Access | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Pico do Areeiro | Drive (ER202) | 1h from Funchal, paved |
| Pico Ruivo | Hike only | From Areeiro or Achada |
| Achada do Teixeira | Drive (from Santana) | Shorter approach to Ruivo |
| Paul da Serra | Drive (ER110) | 1h from Funchal |
| Encumeada | Drive (ER104/228) | Between Ribeira Brava and S. Vicente |

### What to Bring

| Essential | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Warm layers | 15°C+ colder than coast |
| Wind/rain jacket | Weather changes fast |
| Sturdy shoes | Rocky terrain |
| Water | Dehydration at altitude |
| Headlamp | For tunnels on hikes |
| Sunscreen | Stronger UV at altitude |

### Weather Considerations

**Cloud inversion**: Often when Funchal is cloudy, mountains are above clouds (and vice versa). Check webcams.

**Webcams to check**:
- netmadeira.com/tempo
- spotazores.com/madeira
- Various hotel/tourism cams

**Best times**:
- **Sunrise**: Magic above clouds
- **Early morning**: Clearest conditions
- **Late afternoon**: Clouds usually built up
- **Winter**: More chance of clear days paradoxically

### Altitude Effects

At 1,800m+ you may notice:
- Breathlessness with exertion
- Faster dehydration
- Stronger sun
- Rapid temperature changes

Not dangerous for healthy people, but take it easy initially.
