# Madeira Beaches & Natural Pools

## Reality Check

**Madeira is not a beach destination.** The island is volcanic with mostly rocky coastline. If beach holidays are your priority, go to the Canaries or mainland Portugal.

That said, there ARE swimming options—just different from typical beach resorts.

---

## Types of Swimming Spots

### Natural Volcanic Pools
Seawater pools formed in lava rock, protected from open ocean. Madeira's signature swimming experience.

### Lidos (Complexos Balneares)
Man-made swimming complexes with pools and sea access. Usually have facilities (changing rooms, toilets, sometimes restaurants).

### Beaches
Few and mostly pebble/rock. One notable exception with imported sand.

## Swimming Safety

### Ocean Conditions

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Water temp | 18-24°C depending on season |
| Currents | Can be strong, especially north coast |
| Waves | South coast calmer; north can be rough |
| Lifeguards | At major lidos/pools; rare at natural spots |

### Safety Rules

1. **Never swim alone at unguarded spots**
2. **Check flags at lidos** (red = no swimming)
3. **North coast**: Often too rough; stick to pools
4. **Currents**: If caught, swim parallel to shore
5. **Rocks**: Volcanic rock is sharp; water shoes help

### Water Shoes
Highly recommended for:
- Natural pools (sharp lava rock)
- Pebble beaches (uncomfortable otherwise)
- Sea access at lidos

## If You Need More Beach

### Porto Santo Island
- 9km of golden sand beach
- 2.5h ferry or 15min flight from Funchal
- Day trip possible (long) or overnight better
- The "beach getaway" from Madeira
- More beach than you can use

If beach is essential, consider 2-3 days in Porto Santo as part of Madeira trip.
