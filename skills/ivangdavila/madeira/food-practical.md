## Dietary Restrictions Guide

### Vegetarian

**Challenges**:
- Meat stock in soups (ask "Tem carne?")
- Meat/fish dominates menus
- Limited dedicated options

**What works**:
- Vegetable soup (sopa de legumes) — ask if vegetarian
- Salads (basic but available)
- Eggs (ovos mexidos, omelete)
- Cheese (queijo), bread
- Pasta dishes (some restaurants)
- Pizza (in tourist areas)

**Where to eat**:
- Hotel restaurants (more options)
- International restaurants
- Ask for "prato vegetariano" — may get something custom

### Vegan

**More challenging** — cheese and butter in almost everything.

**Strategies**:
- Explain clearly: "Não como carne, peixe, ovos, leite, queijo, manteiga"
- Cook at home (shop at Pingo Doce organic section)
- Fruit-based breakfasts/snacks
- Seek out health food cafés in Funchal

### Gluten-Free

| Safe | Risky | Unsafe |
|------|-------|--------|
| Grilled fish | Soups (may have bread) | Bolo do caco |
| Grilled meat | Sauces (flour thickeners) | Fried fish |
| Potatoes | Processed meats | Bread basket |
| Rice | Milho frito (usually) | Desserts |
| Salads | Stock cubes | Beer |

**Say**: "Sou celíaco/a. Não posso comer glúten — farinha, pão, trigo."

### Allergies

**Shellfish/fish**: Common in cooking; specify clearly.
**Nuts**: Present in bolo de mel, some desserts.
**Dairy**: In many dishes; harder to avoid than expected.

**Emergency card**: Write allergies in Portuguese, show to server.

### Reality
