## Alternatives to Formal Coworking

### Hotel Lobbies
Many hotel lobbies tolerate quiet workers:
- Buy a coffee, work for a few hours
- Generally reliable wifi
- Power usually available
- Best in quieter 4-5 star hotels

### Cafés
See `nomad.md` for café list. Reality check:
- Wifi varies dramatically
- Power often limited
- Buy regularly (every 1-2 hours)
- Not suitable for video calls

### Apartment Working
Most common approach:
- Check wifi speed before booking (ask for screenshot)
- Many apartments have fiber (100+ Mbps)
- No social aspect but full flexibility
- Can create perfect personal setup
