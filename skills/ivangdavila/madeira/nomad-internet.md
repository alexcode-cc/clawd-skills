# Madeira Internet & Connectivity

## Overview

Madeira has good internet infrastructure—better than many expect for a small Atlantic island. Fiber is widely available in towns, 4G/5G coverage is strong, and most digital nomad work is well-supported.

## Working Remotely: What Works

### Video Calls

| Quality | Min Download | Min Upload | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Audio only | 0.5 Mbps | 0.5 Mbps | Works almost anywhere |
| SD video | 1.5 Mbps | 1.5 Mbps | Basic calls fine |
| HD video | 4 Mbps | 4 Mbps | Most home fiber |
| Group HD | 8+ Mbps | 4+ Mbps | Needs decent connection |

**Reality**: Fiber connections easily handle HD video. Mobile can too (4G/5G). ADSL may struggle with upload.

### Specific Tools

| Tool | Works Well? | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Zoom | ✅ | No issues on fiber |
| Google Meet | ✅ | Same |
| Teams | ✅ | Same |
| Slack | ✅ | Low bandwidth |
| GitHub | ✅ | No issues |
| AWS/Cloud | ✅ | Latency fine for EU servers |

### Latency

| To Where | Typical Latency |
|----------|-----------------|
| Lisbon | 15-25ms |
| London | 30-50ms |
| Frankfurt | 35-55ms |
| New York | 80-120ms |
| San Francisco | 140-180ms |
| Singapore | 180-250ms |

**Impact**: Fine for most work. Noticeable for real-time gaming, less for work tools.

## Testing Before Booking

### What to Ask Hosts

1. "What is your wifi speed? Can you share a speedtest?"
2. "Is it fiber or ADSL?"
3. "How many people share the connection?"
4. "Is there Ethernet available?"
5. "What's mobile signal like inside?"

### Tools for Testing

- **Speedtest.net / Fast.com**: Basic speed
- **Ping test**: Latency to your work servers
- **Video call test**: Do a test call first day

### Red Flags
- Host doesn't know speed
- "Good wifi" without numbers
- ADSL in modern building (should have fiber)
- No backup plan discussed

---

## Building Redundancy

### Essential for Reliable Work

| Layer | Purpose | Cost |
|-------|---------|------|
| Primary (apartment fiber) | Main connection | Included in rent |
| Backup 1 (mobile data) | Outage protection | €25-35/month |
| Backup 2 (coworking) | Different location | €0-200/month |

### Power Considerations
- Power outages rare but possible
- Laptop battery is your friend
- UPS for desktop setups
- Mobile hotspot works during outages (if tower has power)

---

## Specific Scenarios

### Heavy Video Calls (5+ hours/day)
- Need: Stable 50+ Mbps, low latency
- Best: Apartment with fiber + ethernet
- Backup: Mobile data ready
- Location: Funchal or major towns

### Software Development
- Need: Low latency to code servers, reliable connection
- Best: Fiber with ethernet
- Backup: Mobile data fine for git push
- Note: EU-based servers = low latency

### Content Creation (Video/Photo)
- Need: Upload speed (fiber symmetrical often)
- Best: 100+ Mbps fiber
- Challenge: Large file uploads
- Tip: Schedule overnight uploads if huge files

### Writing/Low Bandwidth
- Need: Minimal
- Best: Anywhere with basic connection
- Freedom: Can work from cafés, any apartment
- Backup: Mobile easily enough

---

## Month-by-Month Internet Strategy

### Week 1-2 (Testing)
1. Use apartment wifi
2. Test at different times (peak hours: 19-22)
3. Test mobile backup
4. Identify cafe/coworking backups

### Month 1+
1. Establish primary workspace
2. Have SIM loaded with data
3. Know locations of coworking/cafés
4. Build routine around reliable spots

### Long-Term
1. Consider own fiber contract (if staying 1+ year)
2. Get best mobile plan
3. Ethernet connection at desk
4. UPS for sensitive work

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Slow at night | Shared building connection | Get own router/line or switch to mobile |
| Video freezing | Upload issues | Use mobile backup, check other devices |
| Drops during rain | Older infrastructure | Mobile backup |
| Can't reach some sites | DNS issues | Change DNS to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 |
| Slow uploads | ADSL vs fiber | Verify fiber or accept limitation |

## eSIM & International Options

### eSIM Providers

| Provider | Coverage | Price |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Airalo | Portugal/EU | €5-15 for 1-5GB |
| Holafly | Unlimited EU | €20-50/week |
| Ubigi | Global | Varies |

**Use case**: Backup while setting up local SIM, or very short trips.

### EU Roaming
If you have EU-based mobile plan, roaming works in Portugal (and Madeira). Check fair use limits with your provider.
