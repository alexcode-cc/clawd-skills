# Madeira Food — Overview & Dining Scene

## Culinary Identity

Madeira's cuisine reflects its Atlantic island position: lots of fresh fish, local meats, subtropical fruits, and Portuguese foundations with unique island twists. The dining scene ranges from simple family tasquinhas (taverns) to refined restaurants—all at prices significantly lower than mainland Europe.

| Base | Portuguese cuisine with island adaptations |

Simple taverns serving traditional home-style cooking. Often family-run, no-frills decor, excellent value. Look for handwritten menus or daily specials board.

## What to Expect

### Starters (Couvert)
When you sit down, you'll likely receive:
- Bread and butter
- Olives
- Sometimes cheese, garlic butter, local spreads

**Important**: This is NOT free. It's called "couvert" and charged (€2-5) whether you eat it or not. You can refuse it.

### Portion Sizes
Madeiran portions are generous. A "meia dose" (half portion) is available at most places and plenty for one person. "Dose" is often meant for two.

### Fresh Fish Reality
- **Priced by kilo**: Ask "quanto custa o kilo?" before ordering
- **Displayed**: Often shown whole; you choose, they cook
- **Seasonal**: What's available changes; ask what's fresh

## Mercado dos Lavradores

Funchal's famous market deserves special mention:

| Upper | Fruits, vegetables, flowers |
| Basement | Crafts, souvenirs (skippable) |

**Best time**: Early morning (8:00-10:00) for fish hall action, before cruise ship crowds.

**What to try**:

- Anona (custard apple)
- Monstera deliciosa (weird but tasty)
- Banana da Madeira (small, sweet)
