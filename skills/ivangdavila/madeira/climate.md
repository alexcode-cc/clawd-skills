# Madeira Climate & Weather

## The "Eternal Spring" Reality

Madeira's nickname is deserved but nuanced. The south coast (where most people live) enjoys mild temperatures year-round. But the island's dramatic terrain creates microclimates—you can experience four seasons in one day.

**Key insight**: Never too hot, never too cold. But "mild" doesn't mean "warm" in winter—you'll want a jacket.

## Microclimates

### South vs. North Coast

| Factor | South Coast | North Coast |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Sunshine hours | More | Less |
| Rainfall | ~600mm/year | ~1,500mm/year |
| Temperature | Warmer | Slightly cooler |
| Wind | Less exposed | More exposed |
| Character | Drier, sunnier | Greener, more dramatic |

**Why**: Trade winds hit the north, bringing moisture that feeds the laurel forests.

### Altitude Effect

| Altitude | Temperature vs. Sea Level |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Funchal (sea level) | Baseline |
| Monte (500m) | 3-4°C cooler |
| Pico do Areeiro (1,818m) | 10-15°C cooler |

**Practical example**: 25°C in Funchal = 15°C at mountain peaks.

### West vs. East

| Area | Character |
|------|-----------|
| **West (Ponta do Sol area)** | Sunniest spot on island |
| **East (Machico, Santa Cruz)** | Similar to Funchal |
