## Common Nomad Mistakes

1. **Arriving without testing internet** — Check Airbnb wifi speed before booking
2. **Staying only in Ponta do Sol** — Miss what rest of island offers
3. **No car for exploring** — Limits weekend adventures
4. **Booking expensive long-term** — Start short, find better deals locally
5. **Only hanging with nomads** — Miss authentic Madeiran experience
6. **Underestimating weather variety** — Pack layers, rain gear
7. **Expecting party scene** — Madeira is chill, not wild
8. **Working from cafés without buying** — Respect local businesses
