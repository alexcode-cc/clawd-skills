# Madeira Wine & Poncha

## Madeira Wine

### Overview
Madeira is one of the world's great fortified wines—unique because it's intentionally heated during aging, a process that would ruin most wines but creates Madeira's characteristic caramelized, nutty flavors. Bottles can last decades after opening.

### The Four Noble Grapes

| Grape | Style | Sweetness | Best For |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Sercial** | Dry | ☆ | Aperitif, with nuts/olives |
| **Verdelho** | Off-dry | ☆☆ | Versatile, with soup/fish |
| **Bual (Boal)** | Medium-sweet | ☆☆☆ | Cheese, dessert course |
| **Malmsey (Malvasia)** | Sweet | ☆☆☆☆ | After dinner, with chocolate |

**Progression at dinner**: Sercial to start → Verdelho with meal → Bual with cheese → Malmsey with dessert

### Age Designations

| Age | Meaning | Price Range | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------------|-------|

### Where to Taste

| Venue | Location | What to Expect |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Blandy's Wine Lodge** | Funchal center | Tours, tastings, shop. Most comprehensive. |
| **D'Oliveiras** | Funchal | Smaller producer, older stocks, less touristy. |
| **Barbeito** | Câmara de Lobos area | Modern approach, by appointment. |
| **Henriques & Henriques** | Câmara de Lobos | Quality producer, tastings available. |

## Poncha

### What It Is
Madeira's national drink: aguardente (sugar cane spirit) + honey + lemon juice, mixed vigorously with a special wooden stick (caralhinho). Simple, strong, deceptively drinkable.

### Types

| Variety | Base | Taste | Strength |
|---------|------|-------|----------|
| **Regional (traditional)** | Lemon + honey | Tangy, sweet | Strong |
| **Maracujá** | Passion fruit | Tropical, sweeter | Medium-strong |
| **Tangerina** | Tangerine | Citrus, lighter | Medium |
| **Manga** | Mango | Fruity, sweet | Medium |
| **Fisherman's** | Rum, wine, lemon | Different base | Strong |

**Start with**: Regional (original) to understand the base flavor.

### Where to Drink

| Place | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Câmara de Lobos bars** | Entire harbor | Birthplace of poncha; any bar is authentic |
| **Bar do Sabino** | Câmara de Lobos | Cash only, proper local |
| **Taberna da Poncha** | Serra de Água | Famous, inland destination |
| **Funchal Old Town** | Various | Available everywhere, quality varies |

### Drinking Tips
- **First time**: Get Regional, small glass
- **Pace yourself**: 30% alcohol, drinks easily, hits hard
- **Food**: Always drink with food or after eating
- **Mixing**: Stick to one flavor per session
- **Morning after**: Can be rough; hydrate

## Local Beer

### Coral
Madeira's local beer brand. Light lager, nothing special but refreshing.

| Type | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Coral | Standard lager |
| Coral Branca | "White" version, slightly different |
| Draft (imperial) | Best from tap |

### Craft Beer
Emerging scene:
- **Madeira Brewing Company** — Local craft options
- **Some bars in Funchal** — Import craft beers

## Other Drinks

### Nikita
Local invention: vanilla ice cream + white wine + pineapple, blended. Sounds weird, surprisingly good. Beach drink.

### Coffee
Portuguese coffee culture applies:
| Order | What You Get |
|-------|--------------|
| Café / Bica | Espresso |
| Chinesa | Weaker espresso, more water |
| Abatanado | Long espresso (like americano) |
| Galão | Latte in tall glass |
| Meia de leite | Half coffee, half milk |

### Fresh Juices
Excellent local fruits make great juices:
- Maracujá (passion fruit)
- Anona (custard apple)
- Tangerina
- Mixed tropical

Ask for "sumo natural de [fruit]" — freshly squeezed, not from concentrate.
