## Common Mistakes

### 1. Underestimating Mountain Weather
- Clear in Funchal ≠ clear at Pico Areeiro
- Check webcams before driving up
- Have backup plan ready

### 2. Not Booking Restaurants
- Popular spots (especially weekends) fill up
- Always call ahead for dinner at reviewed restaurants

### 3. Relying Only on Google Maps
- Some levada trailheads not accurately marked
- Download offline maps + use local hiking apps
- WalkMe Madeira app helpful

### 4. Overpacking Itinerary
- Driving takes longer than expected (curves!)
- Build in buffer time
- One major activity per day is plenty

### 5. Skipping Travel Insurance
- Levadas have risks (falls, turned ankles)
- Helicopter rescues happen
- Make sure adventure activities covered

### 6. Sunday Planning Failures
- Many restaurants closed Sunday afternoon/evening
- Supermarkets close Sunday afternoon
- Plan meals around this

### 7. Last-Minute Levada Decisions
- Popular levadas (25 Fontes) get crowded by 10am
- Start early or go late afternoon
- Weekdays less busy

### 8. Ignoring Altitude
- Pico Areeiro at 1,818m
- Can feel breathless if not acclimatized
- Don't rush physical activity at altitude
