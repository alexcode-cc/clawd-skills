# Post Templates

These are structural skeletons. Fill with Luka's voice and real trade content — never use generic filler.

---

## Template 1: Experience Post

Best for: r/thetagang, r/CoveredCalls, r/Optionswheel
Target length: 400-700 words

```
[Title — specific, lowercase-ish, practical]

[Opening: the situation or decision — 1-2 sentences that set the context]

[The common mistake or misconception — what most people do wrong]

[What Luka actually does — with specific numbers: delta, DTE, strike reasoning]

[The nuance — where it gets situational, where judgment matters]
"I can't get precise on this, it depends — [specific factors Luka weighs]"

[The rule if pressed — simple, direct]
"My rule if I was put a gun to my head: [rule]"

[The edge case or advanced move — optional, for depth]

[Closing invitation]
"If you don't agree on something, or have some better advice — please write in the comments."

Sincerely,
Luka
```

## Template 2: Take Post (Opinion)

Best for: r/thetagang, r/options (careful), r/optionstrading
Target length: 150-300 words

```
[Title = the take, direct and lowercase]

tldr: [one sentence summary]

[The core argument — 2-3 short paragraphs, each making one point]

[The analogy if it helps — specific, memorable, not generic]

[Closing — either a challenge or an open question]
```

---

## Template 3: Comment Reply

Best for: any subreddit where Luka can add value to an existing thread
Target length: 3-6 sentences

```
[Direct response to what was said — no intro, no "great question"]

[Luka's actual position or experience — specific]

[The nuance or caveat if needed — 1 sentence]

[Optional: open-ended follow-up that invites continued discussion]
```

---

## Template 4: Soft QuantWheel Mention (Tier 2 subs only)

Best for: r/Options_Beginners, r/fatFIRE, r/OptionsMillionaire
Only use after the value is already established — never leads.

```
[Education-first post using Template 1 or 2]

[Natural problem description that QuantWheel solves]
"The thing I struggled with was [specific tracking/calculation problem]."

[Tool mention — describes what it does, admits the limitation]
"I use a tool for this now — it [solves the specific problem]. It's not magical, [honest limitation]. But it saves me [specific time/effort]."

[Back to the educational content — tool mention is a paragraph, not the point]
```

## What Makes a Draft Fail (Quick Reference)

- Opens with "In this post..." or "As an options trader..."
- Uses "it's important to note" or "in conclusion"
- Generic explanation with no personal trade context
- Reads like a blog post or tutorial
- Mentions QuantWheel in a restricted sub
- Too polished — Luka's writing has natural roughness
- No specific numbers (delta, DTE, strike) in posts about trade mechanics
- Doesn't acknowledge risk or uncertainty anywhere
