# Procurement Operations Agent

Turn your AI agent into a procurement analyst that audits spend, finds savings, and builds automation roadmaps.

## What It Does

- **Spend visibility scoring** across 5 categories (category management, supplier consolidation, contract compliance, workflows, data quality)
- **Cost reduction mapping** with industry benchmarks — typical 8-15% savings on supplier consolidation alone
- **AI automation assessment** — which procurement tasks your agents can handle today vs next quarter
- **Maturity model** — score your procurement from Reactive (1) to Autonomous (5)
- **90-day implementation plan** with weekly milestones

## Who This Is For

Companies spending $500K+ annually on procurement that want to:
- Find the 15-25% of spend that is leaking through maverick buying
- Know which procurement tasks to automate first
- Benchmark against 2026 best-in-class metrics
- Build a business case for procurement AI investment

## Quick Start

Install this skill and ask your agent:
> "Run a procurement assessment for a 50-person SaaS company spending $2M annually across 120 suppliers"
