# Talent Acquisition Framework

End-to-end hiring system — from workforce planning through offer negotiation to 90-day onboarding. Built for companies scaling from 15-500 employees who need to hire fast without burning cash on bad fits.

## What This Covers

### 1. Hiring Pipeline Architecture
- **Req-to-offer pipeline**: 7 stages with conversion benchmarks (application→screen 25%, screen→interview 40%, interview→offer 60%, offer→accept 85%)
- **Time-to-fill targets by role**: Engineering 45 days, Sales 35 days, Executive 75 days, Support 25 days
- **Cost-per-hire benchmarks**: $4,700 avg (SHRM 2025), but varies 2-10x by seniority
- **Source effectiveness**: Employee referrals (45% hire rate, 25 days avg) > LinkedIn (12%, 42 days) > Job boards (5%, 51 days)

### 2. Job Architecture & Leveling
```
Level | Title Pattern        | Scope           | Comp Range (US, 2026)
------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------
IC1   | Associate/Junior     | Task execution  | $55K-$85K
IC2   | Mid-level           | Project scope   | $85K-$130K
IC3   | Senior              | Team influence  | $120K-$180K
IC4   | Staff/Principal     | Org influence   | $160K-$250K
IC5   | Distinguished       | Company-wide    | $200K-$350K+
M1    | Manager             | 4-8 directs     | $130K-$200K
M2    | Director            | Function        | $180K-$280K
M3    | VP                  | Department      | $250K-$400K+
```

### 3. Sourcing Strategy Matrix
| Channel | Best For | Cost | Time to First Hire |
|---------|----------|------|-------------------|
| Employee referrals | All roles | $1K-$5K bonus | 2-3 weeks |
| LinkedIn Recruiter | IC3+ & executives | $8K-$12K/yr/seat | 3-6 weeks |
| Job boards (Indeed/Glassdoor) | IC1-IC2 volume | $200-$500/post | 4-8 weeks |
| Recruiting agency | Urgent/executive | 20-25% first year | 4-8 weeks |
| University programs | IC1 pipeline | $5K-$15K/event | 2-6 months |
| Contractor-to-hire | Risk mitigation | 1.3-1.5x hourly | 1-3 months |

### 4. Interview Scorecard System
Rate candidates 1-5 across these dimensions:
- **Technical competency** (weight: 30%) — can they do the work?
- **Problem-solving approach** (20%) — how do they think?
- **Communication clarity** (15%) — can they explain their thinking?
- **Culture contribution** (15%) — what do they ADD to the team?
- **Growth trajectory** (10%) — where are they heading?
- **Role-specific criteria** (10%) — domain expertise, tools, certifications

**Scoring**: 4.0+ = Strong Hire, 3.5-3.9 = Hire, 3.0-3.4 = Borderline (needs discussion), <3.0 = No Hire

### 5. Offer Engineering
```
Base salary: Market 50th percentile (conservative) or 65th (competitive)
Equity/options: 0.01-0.5% for IC, 0.5-2% for directors, 1-5% for VP+
Signing bonus: 10-20% of base for competitive situations
Benefits value: Add 25-35% to base for total comp messaging

Counter-offer response framework:
- Match within 10% → counter immediately
- 10-20% gap → add equity/signing bonus, don't inflate base
- >20% gap → let them go (they'll leave in 6 months anyway)
```

### 6. Diversity & Inclusion Hiring
- Blind resume screening (remove names, schools, photos)
- Structured interviews only (same questions, same order, same rubric)
- Diverse interview panels (minimum 2 different backgrounds)
- Source from underrepresented communities (30%+ pipeline target)
- Track conversion rates by demographic at each stage

### 7. 90-Day Onboarding Checkpoints
| Day | Milestone | Owner |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| 0 | Equipment + access ready BEFORE start | IT/HR |
| 1 | Welcome, team intros, buddy assigned | Manager |
| 7 | First small win shipped | New hire |
| 14 | 1:1 — role clarity check | Manager |
| 30 | 30-day review — mutual feedback | Manager |
| 45 | First meaningful project complete | New hire |
| 60 | Cross-team collaboration started | New hire |
| 90 | Full review — stay/adjust/exit decision | Manager + HR |

### 8. Recruiting Metrics Dashboard
Track monthly:
- **Time-to-fill** by role type (target: <45 days avg)
- **Cost-per-hire** (target: <$5K for IC, <$15K for leadership)
- **Quality-of-hire** (90-day performance rating, 180-day retention)
- **Offer acceptance rate** (target: >85%)
- **Source effectiveness** (hires per source, cost per source)
- **Pipeline velocity** (candidates per stage, stage conversion rates)
- **Diversity pipeline %** (target: reflect market demographics)

### 9. Employer Brand Checklist
- [ ] Glassdoor rating >4.0 (respond to ALL reviews within 48h)
- [ ] Careers page with real employee stories (not stock photos)
- [ ] Salary transparency (at minimum, ranges in job posts)
- [ ] Interview process documented publicly
- [ ] Social proof: team content on LinkedIn monthly
- [ ] Candidate experience survey (post-interview, even rejections)

### 10. Common Hiring Mistakes
1. **Hiring for culture "fit" instead of culture "add"** — fit = homogeneity, add = diversity of thought
2. **No structured interviews** — unstructured interviews predict performance at 14% vs 51% structured
3. **Ghosting candidates** — 72% share bad experiences, damages brand for years
4. **Optimizing for speed over quality** — a bad hire costs 30-50% of annual salary
5. **Ignoring internal candidates** — external hires take 3 years to match internal promotion performance
6. **Comp anchored to current salary** — pay for the role, not the person's history
7. **No hiring plan** — reactive hiring costs 2-3x proactive pipeline building
