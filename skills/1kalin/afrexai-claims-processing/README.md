# Claims Processing Automation

Structured claims intake, triage, fraud screening, adjudication, and payment authorization for insurance, healthcare, warranty, and financial services.

## What's Inside

- **8-gate intake validation** — Policy verification through assignment routing
- **Triage scoring matrix** — 6-factor, 0-100 scoring with auto-routing rules
- **12 fraud red flags** — Pattern detection checklist with escalation tiers
- **Adjudication decision tree** — Coverage analysis through payment authorization
- **5-tier payment authority** — From auto-pay to C-suite approval
- **2026 SLA benchmarks** — Cycle time, straight-through rate, leakage, satisfaction
- **Cost-of-poor-processing** — $14M+ recoverable per 10K claims/year
- **Agent automation map** — 7 functions, $1.68M annual savings potential
- **Regulatory compliance** — By line of business (P&C, health, workers comp, auto, life, financial)
- **Appeals framework** — Internal/external review with overturn rate benchmarks

## Who This Is For

- Insurance operations teams modernizing claims handling
- Healthcare organizations automating reimbursement workflows
