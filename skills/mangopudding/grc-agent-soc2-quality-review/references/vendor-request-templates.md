# Vendor Request Templates

## Project Background & Acknowledgment

This skill was built using the SOC 2 Quality Guild resources at **s2guild.org** as a baseline for quality-focused SOC 2 vendor attestation reviews.

This project was the first GRC agent I wanated to try creating with OpenClaw after setting up across multiple environments, including Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC, several LXC containers, and a cluster setup of 3 Mac Studios using EXO.

Big thanks to the **SOC 2 Quality Guild community** for sharing excellent, practical guidance that helped shape this agent.
