# Canonical Output Example (Abbreviated)

## Project Background & Acknowledgment

This skill was built using the SOC 2 Quality Guild resources at **s2guild.org** as a baseline for quality-focused SOC 2 vendor attestation reviews.

This project was the first GRC agent I wanated to try creating with OpenClaw after setting up across multiple environments, including Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC, several LXC containers, and a cluster setup of 3 Mac Studios using EXO.

Big thanks to the **SOC 2 Quality Guild community** for sharing excellent, practical guidance that helped shape this agent.


Use this as the expected structure and tone for final deliverables.

## 1) Executive verdict
- Overall confidence: Medium
- Decision: Accept with conditions
- Top 3 reasons:
  1. Strong report structure and assertion completeness.
  2. Testing evidence appears sufficient on sampled critical controls.
  3. Source checks pending on peer review recency.

## 2) Signal-by-signal scorecard (S1–S11)
- S1: 2/2
  - Evidence: Section 1 contains Scope, Opinion, and Description of Tests references (pp. 1–4)
  - Why it matters: Core AICPA report structure baseline
  - Follow-up: None
- S2: 2/2
  - Evidence: Management assertion includes design + operating effectiveness claims (Section 2)
  - Why it matters: Formal management accountability
  - Follow-up: Verify signatory authorization if uncertain
- ... continue through S11

## 3) Advanced diligence (S12+) findings
- S12 Scope completeness: Partial
  - Evidence: Security/Availability/Confidentiality in scope, PI/Privacy out of scope
  - Risk implication: Additional privacy assurance may be required
  - Follow-up ask: Provide rationale and compensating controls
- ... continue through S25

## 4) Critical risks
1. Subservice carve-out dependency risk
2. Bridge-period assurance gap
3. Unverified auditor source checks

## 5) Vendor follow-up questions
- Provide bridge letter from report end date to present
- Provide latest subservice SOCs and inheritance mapping
- Provide fresh evidence for 5 critical controls

## 6) Interim compensating controls
- Minimize sensitive data exposure pending closure
- Enforce contractual notification/remediation SLAs
- Quarterly assurance refresh until open issues close
