# Kéfir Troubleshooting Guide

Complete diagnostic guide for common kéfir fermentation problems and solutions.

## Grain Health Issues

### Soft or Mushy Grains

**Symptoms:**
- Grains feel soft, mushy, or break apart easily
- Loss of characteristic firm, bouncy texture
- Reduced fermentation activity

**Causes:**
- Over-fermentation (left too long in sugar solution)
- Contamination with harmful bacteria
- Poor water quality (too much chlorine)
- Nutrient depletion

**Solutions:**
1. **Rest period**: Place grains in fresh sugar water in fridge for 1-2 days
2. **Gentle refresh**: Use filtered/dechlorinated water only
3. **Reduce fermentation time**: Check batches more frequently
4. **Mineral boost**: Add pinch of unrefined sea salt
5. **Fresh start**: If severe, obtain new grains from healthy culture

### Grains Not Multiplying

**Symptoms:**
- No increase in grain volume over weeks/months
- Slow fermentation times
- Weak fizz in final product

**Causes:**
- Insufficient nutrients in environment
- Temperature too low consistently
- Infrequent use (grains need regular feeding)
- Chlorinated water damage

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase feeding frequency**: Use grains 2-3 times per week minimum
2. **Optimize temperature**: Maintain 20-25°C during fermentation
3. **Nutrient boost**: Add organic molasses (1 tsp per liter) occasionally
4. **Water improvement**: Use filtered or spring water exclusively
5. **Patience**: Healthy multiplication can take 4-6 weeks to establish

### White Film or Mold

**Symptoms:**
- White fuzzy growth on surface
- Musty or off odors
- Grains look different color/texture

**Critical Assessment:**
- **Kéfir film** (harmless): Thin, smooth, slightly bubbly white layer
- **Mold** (dangerous): Fuzzy, thick, colored patches (green/black/blue)

**If Mold:**
1. **Discard everything**: Grains, liquid, container
2. **Deep clean**: Sanitize all equipment with vinegar solution
3. **Start fresh**: Obtain new grains from reliable source

**If Kéfir Film:**
1. **Normal occurrence**: Can be stirred in or skimmed off
2. **Check conditions**: Usually indicates longer fermentation needed
3. **Adjust timing**: Reduce fermentation time slightly

## Fermentation Problems

### Too Sweet (Under-fermented)

**Symptoms:**
- Final product tastes too sweet
- Little to no fizz
- Clear appearance

**Causes:**
- Not enough grains for volume
- Temperature too low
- Fermentation time too short
- Weak/inactive grains

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase grain ratio**: Use 60-80g grains per liter
2. **Extend time**: Add 12-24 hours to fermentation
3. **Warm environment**: Move to warmer location (22-25°C)
4. **Grain activation**: Feed grains more frequently

### Too Sour (Over-fermented)

**Symptoms:**
- Very tart, acidic taste
- Possible alcohol smell
- Grains may be stressed

**Causes:**
- Too many grains for volume
- Temperature too high
- Fermentation time too long

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce grain ratio**: Use 40-50g grains per liter
2. **Shorter fermentation**: Check after 18-24 hours
3. **Cool environment**: Move to cooler location (18-22°C)
4. **Dilute result**: Add fresh water to current batch

### No Carbonation

**Symptoms:**
- Final product is flat
- No fizz when opened
- Tastes correct otherwise

**Causes:**
- Insufficient second fermentation
- Bottles not airtight
- Low sugar content for carbonation
- Temperature too low for bottle conditioning

**Solutions:**
1. **Proper bottles**: Use flip-top or pressure-rated bottles
2. **Second fermentation**: 12-24 hours at room temperature in sealed bottles
3. **Add priming sugar**: 1-2g sugar per 500ml bottle before sealing
4. **Warm location**: Keep bottles at 20-25°C for carbonation
5. **Test seal**: Ensure bottles are completely airtight

## Water Quality Issues

### Chlorinated Water Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Slow fermentation
- Weak grain multiplication
- Off flavors

**Solutions:**
1. **Dechlorination**: Let tap water stand 24 hours before use
2. **Filtration**: Use carbon filter or buy filtered water
3. **Vitamin C method**: Add tiny pinch ascorbic acid to neutralize chlorine

### Hard Water Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow fermentation
- Mineral taste in final product
- Grain stress over time

**Solutions:**
1. **Use spring water**: Best option for consistent results
2. **Water softening**: Use distilled water occasionally (not exclusively)
3. **Mineral balance**: Add pinch of sea salt if using distilled water

## Seasonal Adjustments

### Winter Fermentation

**Common issues:**
- Slow fermentation due to cold
- Grains become less active

**Solutions:**
- Increase fermentation time to 36-48 hours
- Find warmest spot in house (near heater, on top of fridge)
- Use slightly more grains (10-15% increase)
- Consider heating pad set to low temperature

### Summer Fermentation

**Common issues:**
- Over-fermentation happens quickly
- Risk of contamination higher

**Solutions:**
- Check batches every 12-18 hours
- Move to coolest location
- Reduce grain amount slightly
- Extra attention to cleanliness

## Emergency Protocols

### Suspected Contamination

1. **Stop immediately**: Don't consume questionable product
2. **Isolate grains**: Separate grains from liquid
3. **Assess grains**: Look for mold, smell test, texture check
4. **Clean everything**: Sanitize all equipment
5. **Rest grains**: If grains seem okay, rest in fridge in sugar water
6. **Start conservatively**: Small test batch first

### Total Failure Recovery

1. **Document what happened**: Note conditions, timing, observations
2. **Clean slate**: Sanitize all equipment thoroughly
3. **Source new grains**: Get from reliable supplier or friend
4. **Start simple**: Basic recipe, optimal conditions
5. **Monitor closely**: Daily checks for first week

## Prevention Best Practices

### Daily Habits
- Use clean utensils always
- Check active batches twice daily
- Maintain consistent temperature
- Use quality water

### Weekly Maintenance
- Deep clean all equipment
- Check grain health and stock
- Plan batch schedule
- Review fermentation timing

### Monthly Deep Care
- Refresh mother grain batch
- Clean and inspect storage containers
- Review and adjust seasonal practices
- Backup grain culture (share with friends)
